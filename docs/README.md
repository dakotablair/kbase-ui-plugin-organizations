# Organizations Plugin - MVP1

## Goals of this MVP

Support single user usage of organizations.8

## User Stories

This MVP aims to achieve:

What user's can see about organizations
- a user may list all organizations
- a user may search all organizations by name or description
- when viewing an organization, a user should see a clear description of each project, so they can understand itâ€™s purpose.
- when viewing an organization, a user may be able to see stats on a projects usage

Creating and owning an organization
- a user may create an organization
- a user may list organizations they own 
- a user may search search all organizations they own by name or description 
- an organization owner may change certain attributes of an organization they own

Things I think are missing:
- an organization owner may remove an organization they own (have created)
- an organization owner may be able to change the unique "friendly" identifier for an organization
- an organization owner may be able to transfer ownership to another user.
- and organization owner should be able to set whether an organization they own is publicly viewable (in lists, search, and org view page) or not.
